Plan:

This is my daily work ...

When I accomplish something, I write a * line that day.

Whenever a bug / missing feature is mentioned during the day and
I donâ€™t fix it, I make a note of it. Some things get noted many times
before they get fixed.

Occasionally I go back through the old notes and mark with a +
the things I have since fixed.

Prefix meanings:
* - completed today
+ - completed later
- - decided against
(no prefix) - mentioned but not done

Initially, I thought of not implementing it; but anyway, we have this now!
